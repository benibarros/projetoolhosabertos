# Projeto Olhos Abertos

## Presentation of the Integrated Project
"Olhos abertos" is an app developed with the purpose of combating harassment against women in public transportation across the Metropolitan Region of Recife.

We know that, every day, women are exposed to situations of vulnerability and harassment, especially in public spaces and collective transport — environments that often form part of their daily routines.

With this in mind, Open Eyes emerges as a tool for support, safety, and quick reporting, allowing victims and witnesses to record incidents in a practical and secure way.

Main Features
Capture of images, audio, and video as evidence of harassment;
Direct and secure submission to police stations specialized in violence against women;
Simple and intuitive interface to facilitate the reporting process;
Focus on protection, agility, and empowerment of users.

Objective
To promote safety, care, and quick response for women facing harassment situations in public transportation, encouraging reporting and contributing to a fairer and safer society.

## Development team
The development team behind this project is composed of students from different fields who joined forces to create a complete and well-structured solution. We have Yasmim Santos as the Scrum Master, responsible for organizing the workflow and ensuring that all development stages follow the agile methodology. Suelen Bezerra led the research, conducting surveys and analyses to guide the group’s decisions. In development, Luís Filipe Harten works on the Front-end, transforming ideas into functional and accessible interfaces, while Ariel Magalhães handles the Back-end, ensuring the system’s logic and functionality. Meanwhile, Fernanda Mello and Beni Barros are in charge of design and user experience, striving to make the project visually appealing and intuitive.

## Used technologies
For the development of the project, we used a set of tools that facilitated both the technical aspects and the organization of the team. Figma was essential for creating prototypes and defining the interfaces, while Notion helped us plan and track the progress of tasks. The code was developed in Visual Studio Code, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android, and Swift and SwiftUI for the IOS version. Firebase was chosen for database management, as it offers practicality and efficiency in storing information.
